# Three Body Simulation

This project implements a gravitational simulation of three celestial bodies using Python and Flask. The simulation visualizes their orbital interactions, allowing users to observe complex motion over time.

## Features

- **Real-time simulation**: Observe the gravitational interactions of three bodies with precise numerical methods.
- **Interactive controls**: Start, stop, reset, and customize initial conditions through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Data visualization**: 3D rendering of celestial trajectories.
- **Optimized performance**: Utilizes high-order Runge-Kutta methods for smooth and accurate motion.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend logic.
- **Flask**: Web application framework.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **SciPy**: Scientific computing, especially solving differential equations.
- **Three.js**: JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Run the application using:

   ```bash
   python main.py

4.  Access the simulation via http://0.0.0.0:5000 in your web browser.
